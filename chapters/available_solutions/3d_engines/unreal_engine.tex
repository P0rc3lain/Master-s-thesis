% " UE4 is not intended to visualise and manage the sheer number of weapons, armor, consumables, conversations, and so on, needed for an RPG."

% UE4 is well suited to bigger games, so think carefully if you're aiming for a smaller project -- various aspects could run slowly, from the editor itself to official support. Unity may be better suited to your needs if you're working on a small game or a mobile game.

% "UE4 comes with the background of being an engine for large AAA titles supporting tons of features for all kinds of advanced systems," Hazelight's Coulianos says. "Therefore the editor can run slow, and seem a bit overkill if you are making a very small and simple game -- for a phone, for example."
